      Offset used to reduce the height of content within exported PDF pages.
      This exists to account for environment differences based on how you
      print to PDF. CLI printing options, like phantomjs and wkpdf, can end
      on precisely the total height of the document whereas in-browser
      printing has to end one pixel before.
